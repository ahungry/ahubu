## AHUBU Helps Users Be Utilitarian

As such, the browser aims to allow this power to shift to what the
*user* needs and desires (via customization / extensions not just as
sandboxed javascript, but native code that can hook into everything
from DOM events, network requests/content, and arbitrary event
listeners, both in and out of the DOM.

## What is it?

A very customizable browser - initial keybindings are a mesh
between Emacs and VIM, as I use Emacs with Evil bindings and that's my
preference.

The closest browsers in default keybindings would be compared to
Firefox or Chrom(e|ium) with vimium/vimperator etc., or one of the
niche webkit browsers such as Lisp Kit or Vimprobable2.

### Why?

Most the good built in keybind browsers (vimprobable2) have outdated
web engines with little maintenance, and the new module system on
Firefox 55+ has weak support for the level of sophistication we need
in handling these key bindings.

## Installation

Make sure you have a java distribution with openjfx available (on Arch
Linux openjdk + openjfx worked out of the box.  On Ubuntu 18.04 I
needed to do some extra work).

### Java Dependencies

#### Arch Linux

Just install openjdk and openjfx

#### Ubuntu 18.04

Install this:

```sh
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:linuxuprising/java
sudo apt update
sudo apt install oracle-java10-installer # accept the license
sudo apt install oracle-java10-set-default
sudo apt install libcanberra-gtk3-dev libcanberra-gtk-module
```

Run the following (until I am distributing the uberjar to run a standalone):

```
lein deps
lein run -m ahubu.core
```

(this will of course require leiningen to be installed)

## Usage

See: [Docs](docs/index.org "Docs") for user guide.

When it exists, you would run that command below.

    $ java -jar ahubu-0.1.0-standalone.jar [args]

## Options

Create an rc file in ~/.ahuburc with contents such as this:

```clojure
;; -*- mode: clojure -*-

{:quickmarks
  {
    :a "http://ahungry.com"
    :b "http://example.com"
    :g "https://github.com"
    :2 "http://example.com"
  }
}
```

Look in conf/url-ignore-regexes.txt for now - any URL patterns you add
here (newline separated) will be stopped from downloading at the
browser's network request level (aka, your browser will never even
attempt to download those requests - effectively blackholing garbage
you don't care about receiving).
