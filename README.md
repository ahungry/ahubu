## AHUBU Helps Users Be Utilitarian

As such, the browser aims to allow this power to shift to what the
*user* needs and desires (via customization / extensions not just as
sandboxed javascript, but native code that can hook into everything
from DOM events, network requests/content, and arbitrary event
listeners, both in and out of the DOM).

## What is it?

A very customizable browser - initial keybindings are a mesh
between Emacs and VIM, as I use Emacs with Evil bindings and that's my
preference.

The closest browsers in default keybindings would be compared to
Firefox or Chrom(e|ium) with vimium/vimperator etc., or one of the
niche webkit browsers such as Lisp Kit or Vimprobable2.

### Why?

Most the good built in keybind browsers (vimprobable2) have outdated
web engines with little maintenance, and the new module system on
Firefox 55+ has weak support for the level of sophistication we need
in handling these key bindings.

## Installation

Make sure you have a java distribution with openjfx available (on Arch
Linux openjdk + openjfx worked out of the box.  On Ubuntu 18.04 I
needed to do some extra work).

### Java Dependencies

#### Arch Linux

Just install openjdk and openjfx

#### Ubuntu 18.04

Install this:

```sh
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:linuxuprising/java
sudo apt update
sudo apt install oracle-java10-installer # accept the license
sudo apt install oracle-java10-set-default
sudo apt install libcanberra-gtk3-dev libcanberra-gtk-module
```

Run the following (until I am distributing the uberjar to run a standalone):

```
lein deps
lein run -m ahubu.core
```

(this will of course require leiningen to be installed)

## Usage

See: [Docs](docs/index.org "Docs") for user guide.

When it exists, you would run that command below.

    $ java -jar ahubu-0.1.0-standalone.jar [args]

## Options

### Custom keybinds/behavior

Create an rc file in ~/.ahuburc with contents such as this (`cp conf/default-rc ~/.ahuburc`):

You can bind any of the following to your key presses:

- A valid Clojure function call (or expression, such as a Clojure lambda)
- A string literal (this will run as javascript in the browser)
- A keyword bind can be a keyword letter, OR a string (useful for CTRL + key binds)

At the moment, rebinding :keymaps will require you to fully spec out your custom keymaps,
so make sure to start with a full config and customize as needed.

```clojure

;; -*- mode: clojure -*-

{
 ;; These shadow into the keybinds with a more concise syntax.
 :quickmarks
 {
  :d "http://ddg.gg"
  }

 ;; These tie to the various modes.
 :keymaps
 {
  :default
  {
   :z "my_custom_js_call()"
   :y ahubu.lib/any-builtin-function
   :x #(println "Hello)
  }
 }
```

### Network Filtering

Look in conf/url-ignore-regexes.txt for now - any URL patterns you add
here (newline separated) will be stopped from downloading at the
browser's network request level (aka, your browser will never even
attempt to download those requests - effectively blackholing garbage
you don't care about receiving).
