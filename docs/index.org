* AHUBU Helps Users Be Utilitarian
Welcome to AHUBU, the best web browser around.
** Getting started / key binds
To move around the page, try the j/k keys for scrolling.

Press 'f' for link hinting.

Type 'o' to pop open the buffer prompt to enter a new URL or search
term.

Press 't' to do the same, but in a new tab.

Use 'gt' and 'gT' to cycle through tabs (or just push 1 - 9 to hop to
the aforementioned tab).

Press 'b' to view a list of your open buffers (tabs) and type some
partial match on the URL or title to filter your results to that match.

To jump to a quickmark (like a bookmark, but much better), press 'go'
followed by te quickmark defined in your ~/.ahuburc file (you do have
one of those right?)

So, if your file looked like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
;; -*- mode: clojure -*-

{:quickmarks
  {
    :a "http://ahungry.com"
    :e "http://example.com"
    :g "https://github.com"
    :2 "http://example.com"
  }
}
#+END_SRC

You could press 'goa' to jump to ahungry.com, or 'gne' to open
example.com in a new buffer.
